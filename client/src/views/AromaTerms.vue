        </dt>
        <dd>
          This is often referred to as the “modern” group since at one time the various aliphatic aldehydes used to create this group were actually “modern” in the time sense of the word. Basically, an aldehydic fragrance may be one to which aldehydes have been added because of their brilliance and incisive effect. Characteristics of all aldehydic fragrances are their brilliant and exciting top note. The classic examples of this would be <a href="https://www.fragrancex.com/products/_cid_perfume-am-lid_c-am-pid_61w__products.html"><span class="fragrance">Chanel #5</span></a> and <span class="fragrance">White Linen</span>.

        <dd>
          The therapeutic use of pure essential oils and herbs in body massage, the rest of which is described by proponents as “healing, beautifying and soothing” the body and mind, has its roots in the folk medicine practiced in primitive cultures. The history of aromatherapy stretches as far back as 6,000 years ago in ancient Egypt. It wasn’t until the 1920’s, however, when the term was actually coined by a French chemist, R.M. Gattefosse.

          COLOGNE
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A term derived from the French name of the German city of Cologne, where this product was allegedly first popularized. Originally, it was the condensate from the steam distillation of a water-alcohol infusion of citrus peels (<span class="aroma">bergamot</span>, <span class="aroma">lemon</span>, <span class="aroma">orange</span>), herbs, leaves (<span class="aroma">rosemary</span>, <span class="aroma">thyme</span>, <span class="aroma">lavender</span>), and flower petals (<span class="aroma">rose</span>, <span class="aroma">orange blossom</span>). With the modern advent of a wide selection of other essential oils and synthetics, this cologne has been considerably altered.<br>
          Today, cologne is usually a diluted version of a perfume using diluted alcohol as its solvent and contains from 3-10% fragrance oil in the finished product. A less expensive fragrance oil is generally used for cologne than for perfume.<br>
          After-shave lotions and toilet waters are technically considered to be in the cologne category. After-shave lotions usually contain 2-3% fragrance oil, while toilet waters sometimes utilize as much as 15% fragrance oil.

        </dt>
        <dd>
          During the process of extraction, flowers are subjected to solvents of various types by which the oils are removed. What remains is a very concentrated oil known as a “concrete.” The concrete is usually a solid, waxy substance representing the closest odor duplication of the flower from which is derived. Since the perfumer cannot use the concrete as such, it is further processed into absolutes that have already been described.

          DISTILLATION
        </dt>
        <dd>
          One of the oldest methods of separating oils from flowers and still widely used. It is a heat-dependent process for separation and purification of a liquid mixture based on differences in vapor pressure of components of the mixture. In each case, the flowers or other sources of oil are changed into a still and heat is applied to separate the oil. One type involves direct contact between the plant material and boiling water. In another type, the heat source is steam that is blown through the flowers. The process involves vaporization of the more volatile component(s) and then condensation of the vapor back to a liquid. The water and oil are collected and as they separate, the oil is removed from the top.

          ENFLEURAGE
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The traditional method of separating the absolute from flowers. The procedure involves placing the petals between layers of fat to which they impart their odor. The layering is repeated again and again with fresh petals until the fat is rich in the flower’s essential oils. The oils are extracted from the fat with alcohol, after which the alcohol is distilled leaving the absolute.

          EXTRACTION
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A process for obtaining natural oils by means of tanks and solvents and is used with certain flowers and plants where the heat of steam distillation might damage or destroy the odorous substances or in such cases where the yield of oils is rather small. In one process, the tank is stationary and the solvent flows over the flowers or other natural matter. The other involves the use of a revolving unit inside of which the flowers move through the solvent. After removal of the solvent, alcohol is agitated through the remaining mixture of waxes and oils and the former is removed by chilling and filtering. The alcohol and oil mixture is then brought to the boiling point, the alcohol filtered off, and the concentrate allowed to remain for recovery. The concrete, as previously defined, is the pure essence in solid form from which an absolute is derived.

          This process is quite similar to enfleurage. In the latter cold fats are used, while in maceration the fats are heated. The flowers are immersed, the cells bearing the odoriferous oils are ruptured, and the fats absorb the oils. To obtain the pomade, the flowers are removed from the fats and fresh flowers are mixed in over and over again until the fats are completely saturated with the flower oil.

          TOP NOTE
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The immediate effect of a fragrance upon the sense of smell. This expression is commonly used in connection with an impact of fragrance upon application to the skin. Careful consideration of this top note is highly important in the design of a fragrance since the initial sales appeal may be totally dependent upon its quality. Chemically, the top note is the most volatile material in the composition of the fragrance oil and often it is deliberately accentuated by the use of a highly volatile chemical; i.e.,in the French practice of using a trace of methyl acetate or propionic aldehydes to emphasize the first “fruity” effect of a cologne top note.
